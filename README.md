# 🏗️ System Design Series

Welcome to my System Design Learning & Articles Repository 🚀

This repo is the structured companion to my Medium series on System Design, where I’ll be covering concepts from first principles to advanced engineering practices.

Like many learners, I found system design resources scattered — great in parts, but rarely comprehensive or beginner-friendly. This project is my attempt to bring everything together in one place: structured, practical, and easy to follow.


# 🎯 What You’ll Find Here

📌 Topics may increase or decrease as the series evolves.


# ✨ Why This Project?

Because I couldn’t find one place where system design was explained with both clarity and depth. Everyone explains bits and pieces, but I wanted to create something structured, insightful, and relatable for learners and practitioners alike.

This repo + article series aims to:
✔️ Simplify complex topics
✔️ Connect theory with real-world engineering
✔️ Serve as a go-to reference for interviews & practical work

# ❤️ Final Note

This isn’t just a documentation repo — it’s a living knowledge base.
I’m writing as I learn, refine, and connect the dots. If you’ve ever felt lost while studying System Design, I hope this project makes your path clearer, more structured, and inspiring.

Let’s build, learn, and grow together 🚀
